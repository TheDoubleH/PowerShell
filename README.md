# PowerShell
My collection of PowerShell scripts used in NAV and Business Central Development Work

# Before You begin
most of these scrips are my adaptation of Waldo's script - I have _gathered inspiration_ from hos scripts, and in fact there are probably calls to his module along the way. You may want to begin by downloading his scripts (located here: https://github.com/waldo1001/Cloud.Ready.Software.PowerShell) before You even look and use these.

# Work in progress
Please also know, that this is very much a work-in-progress (think animated gif's in the '90s)

# My Setup
After failing miserably getting Docker up and running on my Lenovo W530, I bought a Microsoft Surface Book 2, Running Windows 10 PRO, I am logged in, using my Office 365 login (Microsoft for Work) - Not running in a true AD mode that is. The reason I tell You is, I have found Docker to be VERY snow-flak'y and behaves differently depending on a lot of different variables.

# File Names
I try and name the scripts to what they do, and use Write-Host to separate out what actually happens. Most of the early files I call DockerCE - <What they do>.ps1 - The reason is, that I have used these for my local environment, using Docker CE. I am sure they could work using Docker EE on Server 2016 etc. and maybe even if You run Docker as per Arent-Jan's method in Hyper-V Isolation (See here: https://www.kauffmann.nl/2017/12/02/running-nav-docker-containers-on-a-local-hyper-v-virtual-machine/). But I was either too stupid to get that to work, or I did something else wrong - or maybe even both, who knows.
  
# Guarantees
I can Guarantee that I do not give any guarantees about the use of these scripts.
